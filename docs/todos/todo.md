---

## Phase 2 — Benchmark completion

### Experiment 1 (baseline vs region over iteration count)

- [x] **Config 3 (hoisted baseline)** — implemented in matmul_1024.vy
- [x] **ITERS=10 on all four configs** — measured (mean of 3):
      | config | peak (MB) | wall (s) | checksum |
      |--------|-------------:|-------------:|----------|
      | 0 | 308.0 ± 6.3 | 1.44 ± 0.03 | 3.47777 |
      | 1 | 62.8 ± 0.2 | 1.46 ± 0.01 | 3.47777 |
      | 2 | 35.5 ± 0.0 | 1.43 ± 0.03 | 3.47777 |
      | 3 | 63.6 ± 0.0 | 1.41 ± 0.02 | 3.47777 |
- [x] **ITERS=100 on all four configs** — measured (mean of 3):
      | config | peak (MB) | wall (s) | checksum |
      |--------|-------------:|-------------:|----------|
      | 0 | 2836.6 ± 2.7 | 13.83 ± 0.07 | 3.47777 |
      | 1 | 63.6 ± 0.1 | 13.72 ± 0.06 | 3.47777 |
      | 2 | 35.5 ± 0.0 | 14.54 ± 1.27 | 3.47777 |
      | 3 | 63.6 ± 0.0 | 13.65 ± 0.36 | 3.47777 |
      Config 0 growth slope: 28.0 MB/iteration. Ratio at ITERS=100: 79.9×.
- [x] **ITERS=1000 extrapolation** — stated in §5.7 from the measured
      28.0 MB/iteration slope. Explicitly not attempted (~28 GB).

### Experiment 2 (boxed vs region vs scratch)

- [x] Done — configs 0, 1, 2, and 3
- [x] Wall-clock parity noted in §5.7
- [x] Check-overhead disclosure rewritten to match the disabled-checks reality

### Experiment 3 (shape specialization) — NOT STARTED

- [ ] New benchmark: boxed `Array<Float64>` vs typed `VyneArray_f64` vs
      scratch, same operation (element-wise add or a small matmul)
- [ ] Measure runtime, instruction count if possible
- [ ] Write up. **NOTE**: the §5.8 slot is now occupied by Safety Checks;
      a shape-specialization write-up would need a new section or an
      appendix. Decision needed: ship without it (declare as future work),
      or add a short appendix with the numbers.

### Experiment 4 (safety) — DONE ✓

- [x] `examples/safety/` directory, one `.vy` per case (10 files)
- [x] `run_safety.ps1` — compiles each, asserts pass/fail with diagnostic
- [x] `test-safety` target in Makefile
- [x] Written up as §5.8 (was §5.9 before renumber)
- [x] `boxed_local_in_region.vy` and `safe_commit.vy` added beyond plan
- **10 passed, 0 failed** on current tree.

### Comparisons

- [x] **Hand-written C equivalent** — `examples/benchmark/matmul_1024_handc.c`.
      Matches Vyne config 2 on checksum, peak RSS (35.4 vs 35.5 MB), and
      wall clock.
- [ ] **NumPy reference** — time and memory for a 100-iteration loop,
      with and without `out=`. **Decision needed**: never started; either
      drop from scope or add as an appendix after submission.
- [x] **§5.7 ISA/codegen footnote** — the "Exposing AVX2 and FMA as an
      opt-in build mode is straightforward future work and is orthogonal
      to the memory-model claim" sentence replaces the dead §6.10 pointer.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Corpus hygiene — DONE ✓

- [x] **§5.6 with current classifier numbers** — table filled in
      (99.5% / 0.226304 / 6.4–6.3 MB / 0.12–0.14 s across three configs)
- [x] **Fix the seed position in ml_seq.vy** — `vmath.seed(42)` above
      "Generating sequences..."
- [x] **Correct §5.7 config count and numbering** — four-config draft applied
- [x] **Re-verify the growth-path decomposition** — replaced with measured
      28.0 MB/iteration (16.7 MB elements + 11.3 MB overhead/copy)
- [x] **Delete §6.7 (growth-path reclaim)** — renumbered 6.8–6.10 → 6.7
- [x] **Check `bench.ps1` flag** — confirmed `--no-scratch-bounds` was used;
      §5.7 header and "Identical wall clock" paragraph updated to match
- [x] **§3.3 cross-ref → §6.7** — verified
- [x] **§8 cross-ref → §6.7** — verified
- [x] **§5.7 dead §6.10 reference** — replaced with prose

**Still to fix (typo, non-blocking):**

- [ ] §5.7 "Identical wall clock": "config 2 at ITERS = 100..., where"
      has a stray `...` — remove.

---

## Phase 3 — Paper updates

**All applied except §1 reframing and §7 stack-array paragraph.**

- [x] **Abstract** — 8.7× / 79.9× at 10/100 iterations / identical-checksum
- [x] **§2.2** — VNE-070 described with soundness gap pointer to §6.4
- [x] **§3.3** — stack-limit bullet present; §6.7 cross-ref correct
- [x] **§4.5** — native scalar ABI documented
- [x] **§5.4** — SLP-vectorization mechanism with disassembly
- [x] **§5.6** — training-loop measurements, all three configs
- [x] **§5.7** — four-config tables at ITERS=10 and ITERS=100, interpretation,
      measured growth slope, config-2 variance, C-row placement, checks-disabled
      disclosure, ISA footnote
- [x] **§5.8 (Safety)** — ten-test table, `boxed_local_in_region` row,
      verbatim runner output
- [x] **§6.4** — syntactic check described, full analysis retained as future
- [x] **§6.6** — "A naming conflation" paragraph appended (storage-class vs.
      shape conflation)
- [x] **§6.7 renumber** — done; §6.7 is now the hoisting subsection
- [x] **§6.7 (new)** — hoisting-gaps subsection: recursion, threads,
      iteration-dependent buffer sizes, with the `1/8` vs `8/8` capability
      result
- [x] **§8 Availability** — benchmark path, hand-written-C path,
      `recursion_capability.vy`, `--no-scratch-bounds` note
- [ ] **§1 reframing — layered, not parallel.** Current text still says
      "Two constructs, described here, address the problem from opposite
      directions." Replace with the layered framing: region provides
      lifetime, scratch provides storage class, region-requirement-on-scratch
      makes shape and escape checks tractable. **This is the load-bearing
      claim behind Phase 5.**
- [ ] **§7 Related Work** — paragraph contrasting scratch with `std::array`,
      `std::inplace_vector`, Rust `[T; N]`, Ada constrained arrays.
      Two to three sentences.

---

## Phase 4 — The design fix — RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DO THIS WEEK

- [ ] (Deferred) Shape-typed function signatures
- [ ] (Deferred) Scratch as a value of a shape type
- [ ] (Deferred) Composability demo
- [ ] (Deferred) §4.3, §4.6, §6.6 updates

**Honest recommendation unchanged: ship the memory-model paper. Save shape
types for Paper 3.**

---

## Phase 5 — Deferred to next papers (do NOT touch now)

**Paper 2 — Linear Tensors:**

- Linear/affine tensor types
- In-place vlinalg ops with static uniqueness proofs
- Buffer pools with size classes
- Copy-on-write with region-scoped refcounts

**Paper 3 — Lightweight Shape-Typed Numerical Programming:**

- Full shape types with arithmetic
- Static memory planning
- Compile-time peak bounds
- Kernel specialization

**Later:**

- Borrow parameters (`&`)
- Views
- Region-scoped cleanup hooks
- Automatic scratch promotion via escape analysis
- Region inference
- Region-scoped threads
- Region-aware FFI
- Activation checkpointing as a language primitive

**Region-vs-hoisting capability benchmark — DONE ✓**

- [x] Recursive function, two configs (hoisted vs. scratch), depth 8
- [x] Result: 1/8 vs 8/8. §6.7 in the paper.
- [x] File: `examples/benchmark/recursion_capability.vy`
- [ ] (Optional) Threaded version with two workers. Not required for this
      paper.

## Remaining work, in order

1. **§1 reframing** — replace the "opposite directions" sentence with the
   layered framing. Two to three sentences. Ten minutes.
2. **§7 stack-array paragraph** — contrast scratch with `std::array`,
   `std::inplace_vector`, `[T; N]`, Ada constrained arrays. Three
   sentences. Ten minutes.
3. **§5.7 stray `...` typo** — remove. One minute.
4. **Decide on Experiment 3 / §5.8 slot.** Recommendation: leave
   shape specialization as future work; do not write it into this paper.
   Note in §6.6 as a natural extension if you want.
5. **Decide on NumPy reference.** Recommendation: drop for this paper.

Steps 1–3 are the only edits standing between the current draft and a
submittable state. Steps 4–5 are scope decisions.
